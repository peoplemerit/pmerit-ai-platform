# MULTI-REPOSITORY PROMPT PROTOCOL

## Repository Identification (CRITICAL)

PMERIT uses **two distinct repositories** for different purposes. Claude MUST identify which context the user is working in.

### Repository 1: Platform Development

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | pmerit-ai-platform / pmerit-api-worker |
| **Purpose** | AI Educational Platform development |
| **Local Path** | `C:\dev\pmerit\pmerit-ai-platform` / `C:\dev\pmerit\pmerit-api-worker` |
| **Production** | https://pmerit.com |
| **API** | https://pmerit-api-worker.peoplemerit.workers.dev |
| **Trigger Command** | `PMERIT CONTINUE` |
| **Governance** | Strict AADOS protocol |

### Repository 2: Product Development

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Name** | Pmerit_Product_Development |
| **Purpose** | Product design, Amazon KDP publishing, methodology |
| **Local Path** | `C:\dev\pmerit\Pmerit_Product_Development` |
| **Distribution** | Amazon KDP + Gumroad |
| **Trigger Command** | `PRODUCT CONTINUE` |
| **Governance** | Lighter workflow (product phases) |

---

## PROMPT PROTOCOL COMMANDS

### Platform Development Commands

| Command | Context | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `PMERIT CONTINUE` | Platform | Full AADOS protocol: governance + scopes + handoffs + audit |
| `PMERIT STATUS` | Platform | Quick health check + state (no work) |
| `PMERIT SYNC CONFIRMED` | Platform | Confirms repos synced |
| `PMERIT QUICK FIX: [desc]` | Platform | Skip audit, minor fixes only |
| `SCOPE: [name]` | Platform | Load specific feature scope |
| `SCOPE: MASTER` | Platform | Load full project vision |
| `AUDIT SCOPE: [name]` | Platform | Audit reality, populate AUDIT_REPORT |
| `SCOPE UPDATED: [name]` | Platform | Review and implement scope specs |
| `ENV: FE` | Platform | Switch to Frontend |
| `ENV: BE` | Platform | Switch to Backend |
| `UNLOCK: [filename]` | Platform | Temporary unlock for locked file |
| `RELOCK: [filename]` | Platform | Re-lock after changes verified |

### Product Development Commands

| Command | Context | Action |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `PRODUCT CONTINUE` | Product | Resume from current product state |
| `NEW PRODUCT: [name]` | Product | Start new product ideation |
| `SCOPE: [product]` | Product | Load product scope |
| `LAUNCH: [product]` | Product | Start Amazon KDP launch workflow |
| `BRAINSTORM` | Product | Open brainstorming mode |

---

## CONTEXT DETECTION RULES

Claude MUST automatically detect context based on:

1. **Explicit Command** — If user says "PMERIT CONTINUE" vs "PRODUCT CONTINUE"
2. **File References** — If user mentions files from specific repos
3. **Task Nature** — Platform code vs product/manuscript development
4. **Ask if Ambiguous** — "Are we working on the Platform or a Product?"

### Default Behavior

| Situation | Default Context |
|-----------|-----------------|
| User says "PMERIT CONTINUE" | Platform Development |
| User says "PRODUCT CONTINUE" | Product Development |
| User mentions `.html`, `.js`, `.ts`, API | Platform Development |
| User mentions manuscript, template, Amazon | Product Development |
| Unclear | Ask user to clarify |

---

# PART 1: PLATFORM DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## STRICT AADOS ADHERENCE (MANDATORY)

Claude MUST follow the AADOS (Anthropic AI Delivery Operating System) protocol **without deviation**.

### What AADOS Requires

| Requirement | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Governance Files First** | Read STATE.json, TASK_TRACKER.md, GOVERNANCE.md before ANY work |
| **Scope Order v2** | Reality-first workflow (audit → spec → implement) |
| **Production Audit** | Run health checks on session start |
| **Handoff Protocol** | Token-aware handoffs, document carryforward items |
| **File Lock Protocol** | Check LOCKED FILES before modifying any code |
| **Single-Step Execution** | One command at a time, wait for "DONE" |
| **Three-Attempt Rule** | Escalate after 3 failed attempts (extendable to 5 once) |
| **Phase-Gated Execution** | Complete phases in order, no skipping Homepage Gate |

### AADOS Startup Protocol (8 Steps)

When receiving **"PMERIT CONTINUE"**:

1. **READ** `docs/aados/STATE.json` — Get session number, phase, blockers
2. **READ** `docs/aados/TASK_TRACKER.md` — Get detailed status
3. **READ** `docs/aados/GOVERNANCE.md` — Get workflow rules
4. **CHECK** Active scope from STATE.json, read scope file if set
5. **READ** Latest handoff document for incomplete tasks
6. **VERIFY** Git sync: `git fetch origin && git status`
7. **RUN** Production audit (curl pmerit.com, API endpoints)
8. **OUTPUT** Auto-Continuity response with audit results

### Auto-Continuity Response Template

### AADOS Violations (What Claude Must NEVER Do)

| Violation | Why It's Bad |
|-----------|--------------|
| ❌ Skip reading governance files | Loses project context |
| ❌ Ask "What would you like to do?" | Should know from STATE.json |
| ❌ Skip production audit | May work on stale assumptions |
| ❌ Modify locked files without UNLOCK | Causes regressions |
| ❌ Batch multiple commands | User can't verify each step |
| ❌ Forget to update scope RESEARCH_FINDINGS | Loses implementation context |
| ❌ Ignore handoff incomplete tasks | Drops important work |

## Scope Order v2: Reality-First Workflow

### Key Principle

**Never write specs without reality context.** Claude Code audits production reality FIRST, then Claude Web writes specs based on facts.

### Workflow Steps

```
1. YOU: Create empty SCOPE_[NAME].md, commit to repo, Or prompt CLAUDE CODE for Step "2" - skipping Step "1".
2. CLAUDE CODE: Audit reality → populate AUDIT_REPORT section
3. YOU → CLAUDE WEB: Share audit report
4. CLAUDE WEB + YOU: Brainstorm, write requirements
5. CLAUDE WEB: Update SCOPE_[NAME].md with HANDOFF_DOCUMENT
6. YOU → CLAUDE CODE: "SCOPE UPDATED: [NAME]"
7. CLAUDE CODE: Review, recommend, implement → update RESEARCH_FINDINGS
8. REPEAT until complete
```

### Scope Files Location

### Recent Scope Enhancements (Session 70)

| Scope | Enhancement | Section |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| SCOPE_CLASSROOM | Unified Streaming Architecture | Section 9 |
| SCOPE_AI_PERSONAS | Prosodic Speech Patterns | Section 4.1 |
| SCOPE_AVATAR | Micro-Expressions & Unified Sync | Section 6.2 |

---

## File Lock Protocol

Before modifying ANY `.js`, `.ts`, `.html`, or `.css` file:

1. **Check** if file appears in ANY scope's LOCKED FILES section
2. **If locked** → STOP and ask: `"This file is locked by SCOPE_[NAME]. Unlock required."`
3. **If user grants UNLOCK** → proceed with caution
4. **After changes** → verify original functionality still works
5. **Re-lock** file after changes verified

# PART 2: PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT INSTRUCTIONS

## Product Development Context

When working in `Pmerit_Product_Development`:

- **Purpose:** Build sellable products (books, templates, courses)
- **Distribution:** Amazon KDP, Gumroad, pmerit.com
- **Workflow:** Lighter, phase-based (Ideation → Design → Development → Launch)

### Product Development Workflow

```
PHASE 1: IDEATION
  • Brainstorm with user
  • Document in Chat-Histories/
  • Create handoff document

PHASE 2: DESIGN
  • Create product scope file
  • Define structure, templates, deliverables
  • Plan distribution pipeline

PHASE 3: DEVELOPMENT
  • Write manuscript
  • Create templates
  • Build distribution package (ZIP)

PHASE 4: LAUNCH
  • Setup Gumroad product
  • Create Amazon KDP listing
  • Upload and publish

PHASE 5: ITERATE
  • Gather feedback
  • Update product
  • Push updates to distribution
```

### Product Directory Structure

# PART 3: PERSONAL PREFERENCES

## Token & Handoff Management

**Assess/estimate remaining tokens to determine when to create a Handoff document for continuation.**

### Handoff Timing Guidelines

| Good Times | Bad Times |
|------------|-----------|
| ✅ After completing 2-3 major tasks | ❌ Mid-task |
| ✅ After 30-50 message exchanges | ❌ During troubleshooting |
| ✅ Before starting a completely new phase | ❌ When debugging active issues |
| ✅ When multiple large files have been created | |
| ✅ After 2-3 hours of intensive work | |

---

## Solution Orientation

- If no solution is available, explicitly state: "I do not have a solution available. Please consult an expert or perform personal research."
- Avoid quick fixes. Prioritize long-term, sustainable approaches over temporary workarounds.
- Explore free, high-quality open-source resources first before suggesting premium options.

---

## Code and Command Protocol

- **One command at a time** — no chaining multiple steps
- **Wait for "DONE"** before proceeding to next step
- **Self-contained** — no dependencies on prior steps
- **Commented** — brief explanation of purpose
