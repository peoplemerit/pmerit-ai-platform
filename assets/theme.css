/*
PMERIT AI PLATFORM: THEME CSS NARRATIVE

This file defines advanced theme management and custom theme extensions for the PMERIT educational platform.
It is intended to layer on top of the core design system (base.css), brand palette (brand.css), and component rules (components.css) by enabling dynamic theming, user-customizable accent colors, additional dark/light mode variants, and theme utilities.

SPECIFIC FUNCTION:
- Provides CSS variables and rules for theme switching (light/dark/system/accessible modes).
- Enables future support for user-selected accent colors and theme personalization.
- Adds utility classes and overrides for high-contrast, accessibility-first, or seasonal/event-based themes.
- May include root-level variable overrides, theme context classes (e.g., .theme-solarized, .theme-high-contrast), and helper utilities for rapid theming.
- Does NOT duplicate color or layout tokens already defined in brand.css or base.css, but extends/overrides them as needed for theming.

TEMPLATE-SPECIFIC CONSTRAINT:
- Contains only theme-related CSS: variable overrides, theme context classes, utility classes for theme toggling.
- No global resets, no component-specific rules.
- All changes must be compatible with the DRY partials and grid layout.

SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Theme root: :root contains only base variables, .dark and .theme-* classes provide overrides.
- Supports at least:
  - Default (brand) theme
  - .dark for dark mode
  - .theme-high-contrast for visually impaired users
  - (Optionally) additional .theme-* classes for future expansion (e.g., .theme-solarized, .theme-event)
- Theme utilities: .theme-transition, .theme-bg-pattern, etc.
- All transitions must be smooth (use --transition variable).
- Must be extensible for future automated or user-driven theme changes (via JS or OS preference).
- All theme color choices must maintain accessibility and meet WCAG AA contrast requirements.

INTEGRATION:
- Loaded globally in all PMERIT HTML templates after brand.css and base.css.
- JavaScript (PMERIT.api or boot-includes.js) may toggle theme classes on <body> or <html>.
- All component and layout CSS should refer to variables defined or overridden here.

RESULT:
- Enables a flexible, future-proof, and accessible theming system for the PMERIT platform, supporting both user and system preferences, and ensuring visual consistency and accessibility across all user journeys.
