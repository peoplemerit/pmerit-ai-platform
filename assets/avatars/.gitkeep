# Placeholder for pm_classic.glb
# 
# This directory should contain the actual GLB model file.
# For now, the WebGLProvider will use a procedural sphere placeholder.
#
# To add the model:
# 1. Place pm_classic.glb in this directory
# 2. Ensure it's under 5MB (compressed)
# 3. Test locally before deploying
