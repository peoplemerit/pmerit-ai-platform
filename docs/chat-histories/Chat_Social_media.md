Questions to Decide
Before I help you set these up, a few decisions:

Handle preference: pmerit, pmeritai, pmeritllc, or something else?
Platform scope: Start with 2 platforms and do them well, or set up all 4 for presence?
Content voice:

Personal (Idowu sharing the journey)
Brand (PMERIT as entity)
Hybrid (PMERIT brand with personal founder posts)


Immediate goals:

Announce Scope Order System launch?
Build audience before next product?
Drive traffic to Gumroad/Amazon?



Would you like me to:

A) Check handle availability across platforms (via web search)
B) Draft bio/profile copy for each platform
C) Create a content calendar for launch announcements
D) All of the above

What's your preference?The Idea is that social media will represent the entire ecosystem for pmerit. See Project Knowledge or visit Pmerit.com to see all that pmerit is all about.Dec 24Synthesized holistic ecosystem vision to inform comprehensive social media strategy.The user wants to set up social media for PMERIT as a holistic ecosystem - not just for products, but for the entire platform including:

The educational AI platform (pmerit.com)
K-12 education with COPPA compliance

Products (Scope Order System, AI for Curious Minds)
The methodology/developer tools

Let me search project knowledge first to understand the full PMERIT ecosystem, then I can help them with social media strategy that represents everything.Let me pull the full picture of PMERIT's ecosystem from Project Knowledge so I can help you create social media that represents everything properly.Searched project for “PMERIT mission nonprofit education platform ecosystem overview”5 results FOUNDER'S STORY & INSPIRATION textAbout Pmerit4 relevant sectionstext.claude/scopes/MASTER_SCOPE.mdtextPMERIT_Founder_Biography.md3 relevant sectionstext.claude/CLAUDE.mdtextSynthesized PMERIT's multifaceted ecosystem to strategize comprehensive social media representation.18sThis is excellent - I now have a comprehensive understanding of PMERIT's full ecosystem.

I'll explore strategic social media approaches that capture the platform's global mission and diverse audience reach.
Key social media considerations include platform selection, authentic storytelling, and messaging that highlights educational empowerment across different cultural contexts.
Potential strategic questions to validate the social media approach involve understanding audience segments, communication goals, and how personal narratives can amplify the broader mission of accessible learning.Now I have the full picture. PMERIT is much more than products — it's a comprehensive ecosystem:
The PMERIT Ecosystem:

Platform: AI-powered education for 3+ billion underserved learners (pmerit.com)
3 Educational Tracks: Global Remote careers, K-12 education, Vocational/trades
Products: Scope Order System, AI for Curious Minds, future offerings
Founder Story: Idowu's journey from Ogbun Village (3.4km daily walk) to Purdue
Mission: "My people perish for lack of knowledge" — education as liberation

This is a powerful, multi-faceted brand. Before I help you set up social media that represents everything properly, a few clarifying questions:

Primary audience focus: Social media reaches different audiences. Should PMERIT's social prioritize:

Underserved learners globally (enrollment)
Developers/professionals (products like Scope Order System)
Institutions/governments (partnerships)
Or balance all three?


Founder visibility: Your personal story is incredibly compelling. Should social media be:

Brand-forward (PMERIT as the face)
Founder-forward (Idowu's journey central to content)
Hybrid (PMERIT brand with regular founder story content)


Handle preference: @pmerit, @pmeritai, @pmeritedu, or something else?

Once you clarify these, I'll dive into research on platform strategies, handle availability, and create a comprehensive social media setup plan that represents the entire ecosystem.Response to 1. is Pmerit is pretty much for anyone who wants change in their lives. People could even take personalize career assessment on the platform; response to 2 is Hybrid; response to 3 is @pmeritDec 24Synthesized user responses and strategized social media setup research.The user has provided clear answers:

PMERIT is for anyone who wants change in their lives - broad audience
Hybrid approach - PMERIT brand with founder story content
Handle: @pmerit

They've also shared a screenshot of the live platform at pmerit.com showing the AI chat interface, learning pathways, assessment features, etc.
Now I need to help them set up official social media. This is a clear request - they want to set up social media pages for PMERIT to promote products and the platform.
I should do research on:

Handle availability across platforms (@pmerit)
Best practices for educational nonprofit/platform social media
Content strategy for hybrid founder/brand approach
Platform-specific strategies

This is a good use case for extended research since it involves:

Checking current status of handles
Best practices research
Strategy development

Let me launch the research task to get comprehensive information.Thanks for the clarity! I can see the platform is looking great — the AI chat interface, learning pathways, and assessment flow are all live.
With your direction:

Audience: Anyone seeking positive life change (broad appeal)
Voice: Hybrid (PMERIT brand + Idowu's founder journey)
Handle: @pmerit

I'll dive into comprehensive research on setting up your social media presence. This will cover handle availability, platform-specific strategies, content planning, and best practices for educational platforms with a founder story angle.# PMERIT Social Media Strategy Research Plan

PMERIT can secure @pmerit handles across all six major platforms—an unusually valuable opportunity that should be claimed immediately. The research reveals a clear strategicProvide one step at a “Step by step” setup of the social media2:12 PMRecognized sequential instruction preference and isolated initial step.The user wants me to provide a step-by-step guide for setting up PMERIT's social media, but they specifically said "one step at a time" - meaning they want me to give them ONE step, wait for them to complete it, then provide the next step.
This aligns with their preferences in the CLAUDE_WEB_SYNC.md file:

"One command at a time — no chaining multiple steps"
"Wait for 'DONE' before proceeding to next step"

So I should provide just STEP 1, with clear instructions, and wait for confirmation before moving to Step 2.Understood! One step at a time, waiting for your "DONE" before proceeding.

STEP 1: Claim @pmerit Handle on Twitter/X
Why First: Twitter/X is the fastest to set up and most time-sensitive for handle protection. It's also where tech/education conversations happen in real-time.
Action:

Go to: https://twitter.com/i/flow/signup
Sign up with PMERIT's official email (preferably contact@pmerit.com or similar)
Username: pmerit
Display Name: PMERIT
Complete phone verification when prompted
Skip profile photo and bio for now (we'll optimize in a later step)

Verification Check:

Your profile URL should be: twitter.com/pmerit or x.com/pmerit

If @pmerit is taken:

Try @pmeritedu or @getpmerit
Let me know which handle you secured


Reply "DONE" when complete (and let me know which handle you got), then I'll provide Step 2.Peoplemerit is what is available3:02 PMValidated handle choice and progressed toward next step.The user has shown me their Twitter/X account. They got @Peoplemerit (not @pmerit). The display name is "Pmerit" and the handle is @Peoplemerit. They have 59 Following and 1 Follower.
This is fine - @Peoplemerit actually aligns well with what PMERIT stands for ("People Merit"). I should acknowledge this, note that it's a good alternative, and move to Step 2.Good! @Peoplemerit is actually a strong handle — it aligns with what PMERIT stands for ("People Merit") and is memorable. Your account is live at x.com/Peoplemerit.

STEP 2: Claim Handle on LinkedIn (Company Page)
Why Second: LinkedIn is critical for B2B credibility — government partnerships, institutional relationships, and professional visibility.
Action:

Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/
Log in with your personal LinkedIn account (you'll be the admin)
Fill in:

Company Name: PMERIT
LinkedIn public URL: Try pmerit → If taken, try pmerit-education or pmerit-learning
Industry: E-Learning Providers or Education
Company Size: Select appropriate range
Company Type: Select Nonprofit or Educational Institution (whichever fits your current structure)


Click Create page

Verification Check:

Your page URL should be: linkedin.com/company/pmerit (or the variation you secured)

Note: Don't worry about logo/description yet — we'll optimize profiles after all handles are claimed.

Reply "DONE" when complete (and let me know which URL you got), then I'll provide Step 3.DONE3:14 PMVerified completion and prepared to advance forward.The user says "DONE" for LinkedIn but the image shows a generic LinkedIn page prompting to "Get the app" - it doesn't show confirmation of a company page being created. I should ask for clarification on what URL they got for the company page, or if they encountered any issues.
Actually, looking at the image more carefully, it seems like they might have just opened LinkedIn and it's showing a prompt to get the app. They said "DONE" so I should trust that they completed the step. Let me proceed to the next step but ask them to confirm the LinkedIn company URL they secured.
I'll proceed to Step 3 but first ask what LinkedIn URL they got.Great! Before we proceed:
Quick confirmation: What LinkedIn company URL did you secure? (e.g., linkedin.com/company/pmerit or linkedin.com/company/pmerit-education)
If you're unsure, you can check by:

Going to your LinkedIn
Tap on the company page you created
The URL will show in the browser/address bar


STEP 3: Claim Handle on Instagram
Why Third: Instagram is essential for visual storytelling, reaching younger learners, and sharing impact stories through Reels and carousels.
Action:

Download Instagram app (if not already installed) or go to: https://www.instagram.com
Tap Sign Up
Sign up with PMERIT's official email
Username: Try pmerit first → If taken, try pmeritedu or peoplemerit (for consistency with X)
Full Name: PMERIT
Complete verification (phone/email)
Skip profile photo for now

Verification Check:

Your profile URL should be: instagram.com/pmerit (or the variation you secured)

Note: Instagram and Facebook share the same parent company (Meta), so securing Instagram now will make Facebook setup easier later.

Reply "DONE" when complete (and confirm both the LinkedIn URL and Instagram handle you got), then I'll provide Step 4.https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/grow/3:15 PMIdentified incorrect URL and redirected toward company page.The user shared a LinkedIn URL, but it's the "My Network/Grow" page, not the company page URL. They need to navigate to the company page they created to find the actual URL.
Let me help them locate their company page URL before moving on.That's your personal network page, not the company page URL. Let me help you find the correct link.
To find your PMERIT Company Page URL:

On LinkedIn, tap the Search bar at the top
Type PMERIT
Filter by Companies
Tap on the PMERIT company page you created
The URL will show in your browser — it should look like:

linkedin.com/company/pmerit or
linkedin.com/company/pmerit-education or similar



Alternative method (desktop):

Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pmerit
If it loads your page, that's your URL
If not found, try: https://www.linkedin.com/company/pmerit-education


Once you confirm the LinkedIn company URL, proceed with Step 3 (Instagram) as outlined in my previous message.
Reply with:

Your LinkedIn company page URL
"DONE" for Instagram + the handle you secured
It could be I configured it wrong or because I’m accessing it via mobile?3:28 PMDiagnosed configuration issue and charted setup guidance.The user is showing their personal LinkedIn profile (Idowu Gabriel), not a company page. They likely haven't created the company page yet, or they're confused about the difference between a personal profile and a company page.
Let me help them create the LinkedIn Company Page properly. This is easier on desktop, but can be done on mobile too.I see — that's your personal LinkedIn profile (Idowu Gabriel), not a company page. No problem! The company page likely wasn't created yet. Let's do it properly.
Creating a LinkedIn Company Page is easier on desktop, but here's how to do it on mobile:

STEP 2 (Retry): Create PMERIT LinkedIn Company Page
On Mobile App:

Open the LinkedIn app
Tap your profile picture (top left)
Scroll down and tap "Pages" or look for "Create a Company Page"
If you don't see it, try this direct link in your browser:

https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/



On Desktop (Recommended):

Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/
Select "Company" (small, medium, or large)
Fill in:

Name: PMERIT
LinkedIn public URL: pmerit (this becomes linkedin.com/company/pmerit)
Website: https://pmerit.com
Industry: E-Learning Providers
Organization size: Select appropriately
Organization type: Educational Institution or Nonprofit


Check the verification box and click "Create page"


Reply "DONE" when the company page is created, and share a screenshot or the URL. Then we'll continue to Step 3 (Instagram).What edit can I make to change the link?4:17 PMDistinguished personal profile from company page creation.The user is showing their personal LinkedIn profile again, and I can see their personal LinkedIn URL is: https://www.linkedin.com/in/idowu-gabriel-0b83743a1
They're asking how to change this personal profile URL. But actually, what we need to do is create a separate COMPANY PAGE for PMERIT - not modify their personal profile.
Let me clarify:

Personal Profile = linkedin.com/in/idowu-gabriel-... (this is for Idowu as a person)
Company Page = linkedin.com/company/pmerit (this is what we need to CREATE for PMERIT as an organization)

They are two different things. The user seems to be confused between the two. I need to clarify this and guide them to create a Company Page, not edit their personal profile.I see the confusion! There are two different things on LinkedIn:

Personal Profile (what you're showing) → linkedin.com/in/idowu-gabriel-...
Company Page (what we need to create) → linkedin.com/company/pmerit

Your personal profile is fine — we need to create a separate Company Page for PMERIT as an organization.

How to Create the PMERIT Company Page
Easiest method — use this direct link on your phone browser:

Open Safari/Chrome on your phone
Go to: https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/
Log in if prompted
You should see a form to create a new company page
Fill in:

Name: PMERIT
Public URL: pmerit
Website: https://pmerit.com
Industry: E-Learning Providers


Click Create page

If that link doesn't work on mobile, you may need to:

Use a desktop/laptop computer, OR
Download the LinkedIn app → tap your profile icon → scroll to find "Manage" or "Business tools" → "Create a Company Page"


Try the direct link first and let me know what happens. If it works, share the company page URL and we'll continue to Step 3 (Instagram).4:19 PMI notice the user prompt is empty, so I cannot determine the primary language. However, based on the thinking block alone, here is my summary:

Diagnosed platform limitation and pivoted toward app-based solution.The user is trying to access the LinkedIn company page setup URL but it's showing "This page doesn't exist" - this is likely because LinkedIn's mobile web experience doesn't support creating company pages well. The user needs to either use the LinkedIn app or a desktop computer.
Let me provide clearer instructions for creating a company page via the LinkedIn app, since that seems to be what the user has access to.LinkedIn's mobile web doesn't support company page creation well. Let's try the LinkedIn app method:

Create Company Page via LinkedIn App

Open the LinkedIn app on your phone
Tap your profile picture (top left corner)
Scroll down and look for one of these options:

"Create a Company Page"
"Business tools" → then "Create a Company Page"
Or tap the "+" icon and look for "Company Page"



If you can't find it in the app:
LinkedIn restricts company page creation on mobile for some accounts. You have two options:
Option A: Skip LinkedIn for now, continue with other platforms

We'll come back to LinkedIn when you have desktop access
Let's secure Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, and Facebook first

Option B: Use desktop later today

When you have access to a computer, go to: https://www.linkedin.com/company/setup/new/


My recommendation: Let's move forward with Option A — secure the other handles now while they're available. LinkedIn Company Page can wait a few hours until you're at a computer.
Ready for Step 3 (Instagram)? Reply "YES" and I'll provide the instructions.Can use this before we move on4:27 PMWeighed personal profile customization against separate company page creation.The user is showing me the "Edit your custom URL" option for their personal LinkedIn profile. They're asking if they can use this to change their personal profile URL before moving on.
This is for their PERSONAL profile URL (linkedin.com/in/idowu-gabriel-...), not a company page.
They could change their personal profile URL to something cleaner like linkedin.com/in/idowugabriel or linkedin.com/in/idowu-gabriel, but this is different from creating a company page.
I should:

Clarify this is for their personal profile, which is good to clean up
Suggest they update it to a cleaner URL
But remind them that the PMERIT company page still needs to be created separately (on desktop later)
Then move on to the next platforms

Let me be helpful here - cleaning up the personal profile URL is actually a good idea for the founder's personal brand, which supports the hybrid founder/brand approach we discussed.Yes! That's useful for your personal profile URL — good idea to clean it up since you're doing the hybrid founder/brand approach.

Quick Win: Clean Up Your Personal LinkedIn URL

Tap the pencil icon ✏️ next to www.linkedin.com/in/idowu-gabriel-0...
Change it to something cleaner like:

idowugabriel → linkedin.com/in/idowugabriel
idowu-gabriel → linkedin.com/in/idowu-gabriel
ijgabriel → linkedin.com/in/ijgabriel


Save

This helps your founder brand look more professional when you share content.

Note: This is your personal profile — we still need to create the PMERIT Company Page separately when you have desktop access. I'll add it to our checklist.

Reply "DONE" when complete and share which username you secured. Then I'll provide the final summary and next steps!What do you? I have an existing facebook account. Do you recommend I open a new one or a business dedicated account?5:33 PMReconciled account management strategy and platform architecture distinctions.The user is asking whether they should create a new Facebook account or use their existing personal account to create a Facebook Page for PMERIT.
Let me clarify the difference:

Facebook Personal Profile = individual person (like "Idowu Gabriel")
Facebook Page = business/organization/brand (like "PMERIT")

You can create a Facebook Page from your existing personal account. The Page is separate from your personal profile - people who follow the Page won't automatically see your personal posts, and vice versa.
This is actually the recommended approach because:

You don't need to manage multiple login credentials
Facebook prefers Pages to be connected to real personal accounts
You can be an admin of the Page while keeping your personal profile separate
You can add other admins later if needed

So the recommendation is: Use your existing personal Facebook account to CREATE a Facebook Page for PMERIT. They are separate entities.Great question! Here's the distinction:

Facebook Structure
TypePurposeExamplePersonal ProfileYou as an individual"Idowu Gabriel"Facebook PageBusiness/Organization/Brand"PMERIT"

My Recommendation: Use Your Existing Account to Create a Page
You do NOT need a new Facebook account. Here's why:

Facebook Pages are separate from personal profiles — followers of the PMERIT Page won't see your personal posts
You remain the Admin — you control the Page from your existing account
Facebook prefers this — Pages connected to real accounts get better trust/reach
Easier management — one login, no juggling multiple accounts
You can add other admins later — if you hire help, they can manage the Page too


What to Do

Stay logged into your existing personal Facebook account
Create a Facebook Page called "PMERIT" (this is a separate entity from your personal profile)
Your personal profile becomes the invisible "Admin" behind the Page

This is exactly how major brands operate — real people manage Pages behind the scenes.

Ready to create the PMERIT Page from your existing account? Reply "YES" and follow the Step 6 instructions I provided above.5:42 PMI cannot provide a summary because the user prompt is empty.The user has created a Facebook Page called "Pmerit" - I can see it shows:

Page name: Pmerit

Contact info shows "Pmerit"

This looks like the Facebook Page is created. Now I need to help them:

Confirm the page is set up
