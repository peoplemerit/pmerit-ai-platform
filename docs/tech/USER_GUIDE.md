## How It Works

2. Review the welcome information and what to expect
3. Read and accept the consent form (your privacy is important to us!)
4. Click "Begin Assessment" to start

#### What to Expect
The assessment consists of **120 carefully selected questions** designed to measure your personality traits across five key dimensions (the "Big Five"). Each question is a simple statement about yourself.

**Example questions:**
- "I have a vivid imagination"
- "I am always prepared"
- "I feel comfortable around people"

#### Rating Scale (1-5 Likert Scale)
For each statement, indicate how much you agree or disagree:

- **1 = Strongly Disagree** - This doesn't describe me at all
- **2 = Disagree** - This rarely describes me
- **3 = Neutral** - I'm in the middle / unsure
- **4 = Agree** - This often describes me
- **5 = Strongly Agree** - This describes me perfectly

**Tip:** Don't overthink it! Your first instinct is usually the most accurate.

#### Auto-Save Feature ⚡
Your progress is automatically saved every 5 questions, so you'll never lose your work. If your browser crashes or you accidentally close the tab, your answers are safe!

#### Resume Capability
Need to take a break? No problem! You can close your browser and return later. When you come back, you'll see an option to continue where you left off. Your session is saved for 30 days.

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Honest** - Answer based on how you actually are, not how you wish to be or think you should be. There are no "right" answers!

2. **Take Your Time** - While your first instinct is usually best, don't rush. Read each question carefully.

3. **Choose a Quiet Environment** - Find a comfortable, distraction-free space where you can focus for 15-20 minutes.

4. **Trust Your First Instinct** - Don't overthink it. If you're torn between two options, go with your gut feeling.

5. **Complete in One Sitting (If Possible)** - While you can save and resume, completing the assessment in one session provides the most consistent results.

6. **Answer Honestly About All Aspects** - Some questions may seem similar or repetitive - this is intentional for accuracy. Answer each one honestly based on the specific wording.

7. **Don't Worry About Career Outcomes** - Answer honestly about yourself, not based on what careers you think the answers might lead to. The algorithm works best with authentic responses.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How long does the assessment take?
Most people complete the 120 questions in **15-20 minutes**. You can take breaks and resume later - your progress is automatically saved.

### Can I retake the assessment?
Yes! You can retake the assessment anytime. We recommend waiting at least 6 months between assessments, as personality traits are relatively stable over short periods. Retaking can be useful after major life changes or career transitions.

### How accurate are the career matches?
Our algorithm combines two scientifically-validated frameworks (Big Five and Holland Code) used by professional career counselors worldwide. The accuracy depends on how honestly you answer the questions. Career recommendations should be viewed as informed suggestions, not definitive answers.

**Validation:** Our matching algorithm has been tested against career satisfaction data and shows strong correlation with self-reported career fit.

### Do I need to create an account?
No! The assessment is completely anonymous by default. You only need an account if you want to:
- Save multiple assessment results
- Track changes over time
- Access premium features (coming soon)

### Can I download my results?
Yes! Click the **"Download PDF"** button on your results page to get a beautifully formatted report you can save, print, or share with counselors.

### What browsers are supported?
PMERIT works best on modern browsers:
- ✅ **Chrome** 90+ (recommended)
- ✅ **Firefox** 88+
- ✅ **Safari** 14+
- ✅ **Edge** 90+
- ✅ **Mobile browsers** - Full responsive support

**Note:** The 3D avatar requires WebGL support. If your browser doesn't support WebGL, the avatar will be hidden automatically, but all other features work normally.

### Is this a professional psychological evaluation?
PMERIT uses scientifically-validated instruments (IPIP-NEO-120 for Big Five, Holland RIASEC) widely used in research and counseling. However, this is a self-assessment tool designed for career guidance, not a clinical psychological evaluation. For mental health concerns, please consult a licensed professional.

### What if I disagree with my results?
Results reflect your responses, not an absolute truth about you. Consider:
- Did you answer honestly?
- Were you in the right mindset?
- Are you comparing yourself to an idealized version?

If you still disagree, retake the assessment or consult with a career counselor who can provide personalized interpretation.

### Can I use this for hiring decisions?
PMERIT is designed for **self-exploration and career guidance only**. We do not recommend using personality assessments for hiring decisions without proper training and complementary evaluation methods. Many jurisdictions have regulations about personality testing in employment.

### How often should I retake the assessment?
Personality traits are relatively stable, but you may want to reassess:
- **After 1-2 years** - See how you've evolved
- **After major life changes** - New job, education, life events
- **Different life stage** - Career transitions, retirement planning

### Is PMERIT free?
Yes! The core assessment and career matching are completely free. We're committed to accessible career guidance for everyone. Future premium features (detailed reports, one-on-one counseling) will be optional paid add-ons.

### What about my data security?
We use industry-standard encryption (HTTPS, TLS 1.3) for all data transmission. Results are stored on secure Cloudflare infrastructure with regular backups and strict access controls. See our [Privacy Policy](https://pmerit.com/privacy.html) for details.
