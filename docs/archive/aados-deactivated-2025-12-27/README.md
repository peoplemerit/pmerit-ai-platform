# AADOS → AIXORD Migration Notice

**This folder has been superseded by `docs/aixord/`**

---

## What Changed?

As of **Session 77 (December 24, 2025)**, the governance system was renamed:

| Old Name | New Name |
|----------|----------|
| **AADOS** | **AIXORD** |
| Audit and Artifact Delivery & Orchestration System | AI Execution Order |

## Why?

The system functions as an **orders doctrine** (AI issues directives → Human executes → Human confirms), not just a documentation/audit system. The new name reflects this reality and aligns with OPORD (Operations Order) principles.

## New File Locations

| Old Path | New Path |
|----------|----------|
| `docs/aados/GOVERNANCE.md` | `docs/aixord/AIXORD_GOVERNANCE.md` |
| `docs/aados/STATE.json` | `docs/aixord/AIXORD_STATE.json` |
| `docs/aados/TASK_TRACKER.md` | `docs/aixord/AIXORD_TRACKER.md` |
| `docs/aados/VISUAL_WALKTHROUGH_PROTOCOL.md` | `docs/aixord/AIXORD_VWP.md` |

## This Folder

Files in this folder are **archived for historical reference**. Active governance files are now in `docs/aixord/`.
