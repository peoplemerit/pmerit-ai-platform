# 🌍 Pmerit Simulation — Narrative Walkthrough

---

## 1. **User Journey: Guest to Global Job**

### **Step 1: First Contact — Guest User**

Amaka, a recent graduate in Lagos, searches online for remote job opportunities.
She lands on **PMERIT’s Home Page**.

* The design is clean, non-scrollable, like Google’s homepage. Note that the "non-scrollable, like Google’s homepage" feature is only referring to the non-scrollable of Google front page. 
* At the center is the **PMERIT AI chatbox**.
* On the left, a set of quick actions: *Dashboard*, *Career Track*, *Customer Service Mode*.

She clicks **Dashboard** out of curiosity. A **Sign-Up modal** pops up:

> *“Create your PMERIT account to unlock your personalized learning journey.”*

For now, she doesn’t sign up — she continues as a guest.

---

### **Step 2: General AI Use — The Receptionist**

Amaka types into the PMERIT AI chat:
*“Hi, I’m looking for a remote career. Where do I start?”*

* **Customer Service Mode badge** activates automatically, introducing PMERIT AI as her *Receptionist/Support Assistant*.
* The AI replies:

  > *“Welcome to PMERIT, Amaka! To begin, I recommend our **Discover Your Path (AI)** assessment. This will help identify careers suited to your strengths and interests. Would you like to start now?”*
Note: Here, Amaka can ask follow up questions and the AI will serve as the Platform Receptionist (play all roles of a Receptionist in an organization)

She clicks **Yes → Begin Assessment**.

---

### **Step 3: Discover Your Path Assessment**

Amaka enters the **assessment flow**:

1. **Learning Style** → finds she learns best through visual aids.
2. **Interest Profiler** → she leans toward problem-solving and creativity.
3. **Skills Assessment** → her strongest skills are in analytical reasoning and communication.

The system generates an **Insights Feed**:

* *Top Pathway: Data Analytics (Remote-Ready)*
* Alternative Pathways: *UI/UX Design* and *Digital Marketing*.

At the end, she sees:

> *“Save results and start your personalized track? Sign up to continue.”*

This time she signs up.

---

### **Step 4: Learner Onboarding**

After email verification, Amaka is redirected to her **Dashboard**. The Dashboard is like a dedicated new page for user activities. Let's use ASU (Arizona State University) as an example, the University has the public facing url "https://www.asu.edu/" then it also has "weblogin.asu.edu/cas/login" representing student's Dashboard for all their activities.

* Left pane now includes **My Classes, Assessments, Progress, Profile, Class**.
* She sees her top recommended path: *Data Analytics*.

She clicks **“Register for Classes”** and is shown an **intro course list** for Data Analytics (Python basics, Excel, SQL, Visualization).

She enrolls in the first course.

---

### **Step 5: Virtual Classroom Experience**

At class time, Amaka enters a **Virtual Human classroom session**.

* The **AI tutor** greets her:

  > *“Today we’ll work on SQL basics. Let’s practice querying a dataset.”*
* When she’s stuck, she toggles **Customer Service Mode** — the AI shifts tone:

  > *“No problem, Amaka. Let’s break this down step by step. Try typing `SELECT name FROM students;`”*

The AI explains, encourages, and even uses **TTS** to read key points aloud.

At the end of class, her **performance results** flow back to her dashboard.

---

### **Step 6: Progressing Toward a Job**

Weeks later, Amaka completes the full **Data Analytics track**.
Her dashboard shows:

* Completed Courses: SQL, Python for Data, Visualization.
* Performance: 92% mastery.
* Career-Ready Badge: *“Remote Data Analyst.”*

A **Job Recommendation popup** appears:

> *“We’ve matched you with 3 remote job openings. Apply directly from your dashboard.”*

She applies, and within weeks, secures her **first remote data analytics internship**.

---

## 2. **Admin Journey: Tier 1 & Tier 2**

### **Step 1: Tier 1 Admin (You)**

As the sole **Tier 1 Admin**, you log into the **Admin Portal**.
Your view includes: *Staff Management, Infrastructure Settings, Reports*.

* You decide PMERIT needs more tutors and content managers.
* You hire 2 volunteers and 1 part-time paid employee.
* The system auto-generates **Tier 2 accounts** for them, sending login details via email/SMS.

---

### **Step 2: Tier 2 Admins**

Bukola, one of the new volunteers, logs in as a **Tier 2 Admin**.

Her dashboard includes:

* Curriculum Management (No-code editor)
* Student Management
* Class Oversight

She uploads a new **Digital Marketing track**, adding courses:

* “Intro to SEO”
* “Social Media Analytics”
* “Content Strategy for Remote Businesses”

These courses instantly appear in the user side for students browsing the *Career Tracks*.

---

### **Step 3: Oversight & Feedback**

As Tier 1 Admin, you check the **Audit Logs**:

* See which admins added content.
* Monitor student enrollments.
* Generate performance reports across all tracks.

You notice Digital Marketing is quickly becoming popular, so you allocate more resources to that pathway.

---

## 3. **General AI Tool on the Front Page**

For guests and employees, PMERIT AI also serves as a **general-purpose AI assistant**.

* A guest might ask: *“Translate my resume into French.”*
* The AI helps instantly — showing PMERIT can double as a **career tool**.
* Employees use it internally for **lesson drafting** and **student inquiries**.
