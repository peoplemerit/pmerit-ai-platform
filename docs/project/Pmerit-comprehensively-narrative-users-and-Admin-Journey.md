## 1. **GLOBAL REMOTE JOURNEY: Guest to Remote Job** (Amaka's Story)

### **Step 1: First Contact — Guest User**

Amaka, a recent graduate in Lagos, searches online for remote job opportunities.
She lands on **PMERIT’s Home Page**.

* The design is clean, non-scrollable, like Google’s homepage. Note that the "non-scrollable, like Google’s homepage" feature is only referring to the non-scrollable of Google front page. 
* At the center is the **PMERIT AI chatbox**.
* On the left, a set of quick actions: *Dashboard*, *Career Track*, *Customer Service Mode*.

She clicks **Dashboard** out of curiosity. A **Sign-Up modal** pops up:

> *“Create your PMERIT account to unlock your personalized learning journey.”*

For now, she doesn’t sign up — she continues as a guest.

---

### **Step 2: General AI Use — The Receptionist**

Amaka types into the PMERIT AI chat:
*“Hi, I’m looking for a remote career. Where do I start?”*

* **Customer Service Mode badge** activates automatically, introducing PMERIT AI as her *Receptionist/Support Assistant*.
* The AI replies:

  > *“Welcome to PMERIT, Amaka! To begin, I recommend our **Discover Your Path (AI)** assessment. This will help identify careers suited to your strengths and interests. Would you like to start now?”*
Note: Here, Amaka can ask follow up questions and the AI will serve as the Platform Receptionist (play all roles of a Receptionist in an organization)

She clicks **Yes → Begin Assessment**.

---

### **Step 3: Discover Your Path Assessment**

Amaka enters the **assessment flow**:

1. **Learning Style** → finds she learns best through visual aids.
2. **Interest Profiler** → she leans toward problem-solving and creativity.
3. **Skills Assessment** → her strongest skills are in analytical reasoning and communication.

The system generates an **Insights Feed**:

* *Top Pathway: Data Analytics (Remote-Ready)*
* Alternative Pathways: *UI/UX Design* and *Digital Marketing*.

At the end, she sees:

> *“Save results and start your personalized track? Sign up to continue.”*

This time she signs up.

---

### **Step 4: Learner Onboarding**

After email verification, Amaka is redirected to her **Dashboard**. The Dashboard is like a dedicated new page for user activities. Let's use ASU (Arizona State University) as an example, the University has the public facing url "https://www.asu.edu/" then it also has "weblogin.asu.edu/cas/login" representing student's Dashboard for all their activities.

* Left pane now includes **My Classes, Assessments, Progress, Profile, Class**.
* She sees her top recommended path: *Data Analytics*.

She clicks **“Register for Classes”** and is shown an **intro course list** for Data Analytics (Python basics, Excel, SQL, Visualization).

She enrolls in the first course.

---

### **Step 5: Virtual Classroom Experience**

At class time, Amaka enters a **Virtual Human classroom session**.

* The **AI tutor** greets her:

  > *“Today we’ll work on SQL basics. Let’s practice querying a dataset.”*
* When she’s stuck, she toggles **Customer Service Mode** — the AI shifts tone:

  > *“No problem, Amaka. Let’s break this down step by step. Try typing `SELECT name FROM students;`”*

The AI explains, encourages, and even uses **TTS** to read key points aloud.

At the end of class, her **performance results** flow back to her dashboard.

---

### **Step 6: Progressing Toward a Job**

Weeks later, Amaka completes the full **Data Analytics track**.
Her dashboard shows:

* Completed Courses: SQL, Python for Data, Visualization.
* Performance: 92% mastery.
* Career-Ready Badge: *“Remote Data Analyst.”*

A **Job Recommendation popup** appears:

> *“We’ve matched you with 3 remote job openings. Apply directly from your dashboard.”*

She applies, and within weeks, secures her **first remote data analytics internship**.

---

## 2. **LOCAL EDUCATION JOURNEY: K-12 Student to College Ready** (Chidi's Story)

### **Step 1: First Contact — Parent Discovers PMERIT**

Mrs. Okonkwo in Enugu, Nigeria is concerned about her 12-year-old son Chidi's education. The local school is overcrowded, and she searches for supplementary online learning.

She lands on **PMERIT's Home Page**.

* She clicks **"Career Track & Explore Paths"** and sees the three tabs.
* She selects **"Local Education"** tab and sees:
  * Early Childhood (Ages 3-7)
  * Primary (Ages 5-11)
  * **Secondary (Ages 11-18)** ← This fits Chidi
  * College Prep (Ages 18+)

She clicks on **Secondary** to explore.

---

### **Step 2: Parent Registration — Guardian Account**

Unlike Amaka (adult), K-12 students require **parent/guardian involvement**.

Mrs. Okonkwo clicks **"Register My Child"** and sees:

> *"Create a Parent Account first. You'll then add your child as a learner under your supervision."*

She creates her account, then adds Chidi:

* Child's name: Chidi Okonkwo
* Date of birth: 2013 (Age 12)
* Current grade level: **JSS 1** (Junior Secondary School 1)
* Preferred language: English (with Igbo support)

The system maps JSS 1 to **Grade 7** in the Maine Learning Results framework.

---

### **Step 3: Grade-Level Dashboard — Different from Career Dashboard**

Chidi logs in (with parental approval) and sees a **different dashboard** than adults:

* **My Subjects** (not "My Courses"):
  * English Language Arts (5 hrs/week)
  * Mathematics (5 hrs/week)
  * Science (4 hrs/week)
  * Social Studies (3 hrs/week)
  * Health & PE (2 hrs/week)
  * Electives (2 hrs/week)

* **My Progress** shows progress per subject, not per career pathway.
* **Academic Year**: 2025-2026

The AI receptionist greets him differently:

> *"Hi Chidi! I'm Ms. Sunshine, your learning helper. Ready to start today's Math lesson? We're working on fractions!"*

Note: The AI tutor for K-12 uses **age-appropriate language** and a **cartoon avatar** for younger learners.

---

### **Step 4: K-12 Virtual Classroom — Subject-Based Learning**

Chidi enters the **Mathematics classroom**:

* The AI tutor (Ms. Sunshine) appears as a friendly cartoon character
* Today's lesson: "Fractions and Decimals"
* Content is aligned to **Maine Learning Results Standard MLR-Math-6-8**

The classroom experience differs from adult learning:
* Shorter lesson segments (15-20 minutes vs 45+ minutes)
* More interactive elements (games, drag-and-drop)
* Frequent encouragement and rewards
* Parent notification on completion

When Chidi gets stuck:

> *"Great try, Chidi! Let's break it down. If you have 3 pieces of a pizza that was cut into 8 slices, you have 3/8. Can you show me what 5/8 would look like?"*

---

### **Step 5: Parent Dashboard — Oversight & Communication**

Mrs. Okonkwo has a **Parent Dashboard** showing:

* Chidi's progress in each subject
* Time spent learning today/this week
* Upcoming assessments
* Messages from AI tutor (flagged concerns)
* **Grade reports** (quarterly)

She receives a notification:

> *"Chidi completed his Science unit on Ecosystems with 88% mastery. He's ready to move to the next unit!"*

She can also communicate with support if escalation is needed.

---

### **Step 6: End of Year — Grade Promotion**

At the end of the academic year:

* System calculates Chidi's mastery across all subjects
* **Promotion decision**: Chidi met standards → Promoted to JSS 2 (Grade 8)
* Certificate generated: "Certificate of Completion - JSS 1"
* Progress carries forward to next academic year

Mrs. Okonkwo receives:

> *"Congratulations! Chidi has successfully completed JSS 1 and is promoted to JSS 2. His records have been updated for the 2026-2027 academic year."*

---

## 3. **LOCAL CAREER JOURNEY: Job Seeker to Certified Employment** (Bola's Story)

### **Step 1: First Contact — High School Graduate Seeking Trade**

Bola, an 18-year-old in Portland, Maine, just graduated high school. College isn't for him — he wants to learn a trade and start earning quickly.

He lands on **PMERIT's Home Page** and uses the AI receptionist:

*"I want to become an electrician. What do I need?"*

The AI responds:

> *"Great choice, Bola! Electricians are in high demand. To get started, you'll need OSHA 10 safety certification, then progress through our Electrical Fundamentals course. Would you like to explore our Skilled Trades pathway?"*

He clicks **"Career Track & Explore Paths"** → **"Local Career"** tab:

* Healthcare Careers
* **Skilled Trades** ← Bola selects this
* Hospitality & Service
* Public Service

---

### **Step 2: CTE-Specific Assessment — Skills & Aptitude**

Unlike the career personality assessment for remote work, CTE has a **trade aptitude assessment**:

* Physical requirements awareness (standing, lifting)
* Hands-on preference questionnaire
* Safety awareness baseline test
* Math skills for trades (measurements, fractions)

Results:

> *"Your assessment shows strong spatial reasoning and mechanical aptitude. Recommended trades: Electrician, HVAC Technician, or Plumber. Your math skills may need some brushing up before advanced courses."*

Bola chooses **Electrician Pathway**.

---

### **Step 3: CTE Dashboard — Certification-Focused**

Bola's dashboard differs from both Amaka's (career) and Chidi's (K-12):

* **My Certifications** (not courses):
  * 🔲 OSHA 10-Hour Safety (Required first)
  * 🔲 National Electrical Code Basics
  * 🔲 EPA 608 (if HVAC crossover)

* **My Trade Skills**:
  * 🔲 Residential Wiring
  * 🔲 Commercial Wiring
  * 🔲 Electrical Safety Procedures
  * 🔲 Blueprint Reading

* **Apprenticeship Opportunities**:
  * IBEW Local 474 (Portland, ME)
  * ABC Maine Apprenticeship Program

* **Employer Partners**:
  * Portland Electrical Contractors
  * Maine State Government (facilities)

---

### **Step 4: CTE Virtual Classroom — Theory + Simulation**

Bola enters the **OSHA 10-Hour Safety** course:

* The AI tutor (Coach Mike) appears as a practical, no-nonsense trade instructor
* Content includes video demonstrations of safety procedures
* Interactive simulations: "Identify hazards in this worksite image"
* Quizzes aligned to official OSHA exam questions

Coach Mike explains:

> *"Alright Bola, today we're covering fall protection. In electrical work, you'll often be on ladders or scaffolding. Let's look at the three-point contact rule..."*

**Key difference from academic learning:**
* Focus on **regulatory compliance** (OSHA standards)
* **Real-world scenarios** (job site situations)
* **External exam preparation** (not just PMERIT assessment)

---

### **Step 5: Hands-On Requirements — Partner Facilities**

Some CTE skills **cannot be fully learned online**. When Bola reaches "Residential Wiring Lab":

> *"This module requires hands-on practice. PMERIT has partnered with the following facilities in your area:"*
>
> * Southern Maine Community College — Electrical Lab
> * Portland Career Center — Trade Skills Workshop
> * IBEW Local 474 Training Center

Bola schedules his in-person lab hours through the platform. His online theory completion is tracked, and his hands-on hours are verified by the partner facility.

---

### **Step 6: Certification Earned — External Validation**

After completing the OSHA 10 course and passing the quiz:

* PMERIT generates a **certificate of completion**
* But for official OSHA certification, Bola must:
  * Complete the DOL-authorized assessment
  * Receive his official OSHA 10 card

The platform guides him:

> *"Congratulations on completing OSHA 10 training! To receive your official DOL card, click here to register for the proctored exam. Cost: $25."*

His dashboard updates:
* ✅ OSHA 10-Hour Safety — **Exam Passed** — Card # 12345678

---

### **Step 7: Apprenticeship & Employment**

After 6 months on the platform, Bola has:

* ✅ OSHA 10 Certification
* ✅ Electrical Fundamentals Course (theory)
* ✅ 40 hours hands-on lab time (verified)
* ✅ Basic Electrical Assessment passed

A notification appears:

> *"Based on your certifications and progress, you qualify for these apprenticeship programs:"*
>
> * **IBEW Local 474 Apprenticeship** — Accepting applications now
> * **ABC Maine Electrical Apprenticeship** — Starts January 2026

Bola applies directly through the platform. Within weeks, he's accepted as a first-year electrical apprentice, earning while learning.

---

## 4. **Admin Journey: Tier 1 & Tier 2**

### **Step 1: Tier 1 Admin (You)**

As the sole **Tier 1 Admin**, you log into the **Admin Portal**.
Your view includes: *Staff Management, Infrastructure Settings, Reports*.

* You decide PMERIT needs more tutors and content managers.
* You hire 2 volunteers and 1 part-time paid employee.
* The system auto-generates **Tier 2 accounts** for them, sending login details via email/SMS.

---

### **Step 2: Tier 2 Admins**

Bukola, one of the new volunteers, logs in as a **Tier 2 Admin**.

Her dashboard includes:

* Curriculum Management (No-code editor)
* Student Management
* Class Oversight

She uploads a new **Digital Marketing track**, adding courses:

* “Intro to SEO”
* “Social Media Analytics”
* “Content Strategy for Remote Businesses”

These courses instantly appear in the user side for students browsing the *Career Tracks*.

---

### **Step 3: Oversight & Feedback**

As Tier 1 Admin, you check the **Audit Logs**:

* See which admins added content.
* Monitor student enrollments.
* Generate performance reports across all tracks.

You notice Digital Marketing is quickly becoming popular, so you allocate more resources to that pathway.

---

## 3. **General AI Tool on the Front Page**

For guests and employees, PMERIT AI also serves as a **general-purpose AI assistant**.

* A guest might ask: *“Translate my resume into French.”*
* The AI helps instantly — showing PMERIT can double as a **career tool**.
* Employees use it internally for **lesson drafting** and **student inquiries**.
