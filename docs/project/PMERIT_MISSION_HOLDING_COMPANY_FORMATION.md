# PMERIT Mission Holding Company Formation Guide
**Date:** December 7, 2025  
**Current Status:** Registered as L3C in Maine  
**Recommendation:** Transition to Mission Holding Company Structure

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

After comprehensive analysis, the **Mission Holding Company Model** is strongly recommended over maintaining the current L3C structure. This document provides the complete rationale, implementation steps, and timeline for transition.

**Bottom Line:** L3C accesses ~30% of funding market. Mission Holding Company accesses ~100%.

---

## CURRENT STATE: L3C ANALYSIS

### What is an L3C?
Low-Profit Limited Liability Company — designed to bridge for-profit and nonprofit, qualifying for foundation Program-Related Investments (PRIs).

### L3C Scorecard: 28/50 ❌

| Criteria | Score | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Foundation Grants | 2/10 | PRIs rare (<0.5% of foundation giving) |
| Government Grants | 3/10 | Many require 501(c)(3) status |
| Venture Capital | 4/10 | VCs wary of "low-profit" mandate |
| Impact Investors | 6/10 | Some interest, but B-Corp preferred |
| Government Contracts | 5/10 | SAM.gov has no "L3C" entity type |
| Mission Protection | 4/10 | No legal lock, just stated intent |
| Operational Flexibility | 4/10 | Stuck between two worlds |
| **TOTAL** | **28/50** | **Not Recommended** |

### Critical L3C Flaws

1. **IRS Non-Recognition**
   - IRS doesn't formally recognize L3Cs
   - Tax classification confusion (taxed as LLC or partnership)
   - No special tax benefits

2. **Limited State Recognition**
   - Only 10 states recognize L3Cs
   - Limits interstate operations
   - Some states may not honor L3C status

3. **"Worst of Both Worlds" Funding Gap**
   - Foundations say: "Too profit-oriented for grants"
   - VCs say: "Too constrained by mission"
   - Result: Neither funding source is fully accessible

4. **PRI Reality Check**
   - Less than 0.5% of foundation investments go to L3Cs
   - PRIs require extensive due diligence
   - Most foundations avoid PRI complexity entirely

5. **Government Contracting Issues**
   - SAM.gov doesn't have "L3C" as entity type
   - Must register as generic LLC
   - Loses mission-based advantages

4. **Public Support Test:** Must receive broad public support (or be private foundation)
5. **Annual Filing:** Form 990-N (under $50K) or 990-EZ ($50K-$200K)

### Technologies LLC Considerations:

- Receives distributions from Technologies LLC
- Receives (limited) distributions from Foundation

**Foundation 501(c)(3):**
