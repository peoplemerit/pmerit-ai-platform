## 🎯 Recommendations

### For PR #18
**Action**: **CLOSE WITHOUT MERGING**

**Reasons**:
1. Introduced more problems than it solved
2. Removed important features
3. Over-engineered the solution
4. User confirmed it made things worse

### For Future Hamburger Menu Fixes

If original issues still need addressing, create a **NEW PR** with:

#### ✅ DO:
- Make minimal, targeted changes
- Preserve all existing features
- Fix specific issues only
- Test incrementally
- Maintain backward compatibility

#### ❌ DON'T:
- Remove existing features
- Change element IDs
- Restructure HTML
- Duplicate code
- Over-engineer the solution

#### 🎯 Original Issues to Address:
1. Half-sliding behavior
2. Z-index conflicts
3. Background scroll issues

#### 💡 Suggested Minimal Fixes:
1. **Half-sliding**: Verify CSS transition completes
2. **Z-index**: Adjust only if truly conflicting
3. **Background scroll**: Add `overflow: hidden` when menu open
