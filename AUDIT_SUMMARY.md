# Audit & Fix Summary - Phase 3.3-B
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Task:** Secret Leak Scan + Career Track Frontend Bug Fix  
**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETED

---

## Overview

This document summarizes the comprehensive audit and fixes completed for the PMERIT AI Platform, addressing security concerns and frontend functionality issues identified in Phase 3.3-B.

---

## 1. Secret Leak Audit ‚úÖ

### Scope
- Full codebase scan for hardcoded secrets
- Git history analysis for exposed credentials
- Configuration file review
- Deployment artifacts inspection

### Results
**‚úÖ NO SECRETS FOUND**

#### What Was Checked:
- API keys, tokens, and passwords in source code
- AWS credentials (AKIA patterns)
- GitHub tokens (ghp_, gho_ patterns)
- Stripe API keys
- Database connection strings
- Bearer tokens
- Environment files

#### Files Scanned:
- 44 HTML files
- 10 CSS files
- 19 JavaScript files
- Configuration files
- Git commit history (all commits)

### Key Findings:
1. **Public API Endpoints**: All API URLs are properly configured as public endpoints
   - `https://pmerit-api.peoplemerit.workers.dev/api/v1/ai/chat`
   - `https://ai.pmerit.com/api/chat`

2. **Environment Variables**: Properly referenced in Cloudflare Workers functions using `context.env.*`

3. **Mock Authentication**: Phase 1 mock authentication clearly documented as development-only

4. **Clean Git History**: No `.env` files or secret-related files in commit history

### Documentation
- Created `security-audit.md` with detailed findings and recommendations
- Includes security best practices for Phase 2 implementation

## 2. Career Track & Explore Paths Fix ‚úÖ

### Problem Identified
The "Career Track & Explore Paths" button was visible in both mobile and desktop layouts but **lacked click event handlers**, making it non-functional.

### Root Cause
The `assets/js/main.js` file initialized menu, toggles, and collapsible sections but did not include handlers for navigation to the career page.

### Solution Implemented

#### Code Changes:
**File:** `assets/js/main.js`

1. **Added `initializeCareerTrack()` function:**
   - Scans for all Career Track elements (both mobile and desktop)
   - Attaches click handlers to navigate to `/career.html`
   - Displays toast notification for user feedback
   - Handles both index.html inline buttons and partials/header.html button ID

2. **Updated initialization sequence:**
   ```javascript
   function init() {
     console.log('üöÄ PMERIT Platform initializing...');
     loadState();
     initializeMenu();
     initializeToggles();
     initializeCollapsible();
     initializeCareerTrack();  // ‚Üê NEW
     console.log('‚úÖ PMERIT Platform initialized');
   }
   ```

3. **Implementation details:**
   - Uses `querySelectorAll('.menu-item, .action')` to find all Career Track elements
   - Text-based matching: `text.includes('Career Track')`
   - Fallback handler for specific button ID: `#career-track-btn`
   - Prevents default behavior and navigates programmatically
   - Sets cursor style to pointer for visual feedback

### Testing Results

#### ‚úÖ Desktop Testing
- **Browser:** Chromium (Playwright)
- **Viewport:** 1280x720
- **Result:** SUCCESS
- **Console Output:** `üéØ Career Track clicked - Navigating to career.html`
