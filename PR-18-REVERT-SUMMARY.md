- Virtual Human Mode toggle

4. Created code duplication
5. Made breaking changes to IDs and structure
6. User confirmed it made things worse

## Next Steps for Hamburger Menu Fixes

If the original hamburger menu issues still need to be addressed, create a **NEW PR** with:

### ‚úÖ Minimal Changes Approach
1. **Keep existing HTML structure** - No changes to menu sections or element IDs
2. **Fix specific CSS issues** - Only adjust z-index/positioning if truly needed
3. **Preserve all features** - Keep all toggles, sections, and functionality
4. **No code duplication** - Single implementation in one file
5. **Test incrementally** - Fix one issue at a time with verification

### üéØ Original Issues to Address
Based on the problem statement, the original issues were:
- Half-sliding behavior
- Z-index conflicts
- Background scroll issues

### üí° Suggested Minimal Fixes
Instead of a complete rewrite:

1. **For half-sliding**: Verify CSS transition completes properly
2. **For z-index**: Only adjust values if actually conflicting
3. **For background scroll**: Add simple `overflow: hidden` when menu open

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What NOT to Do
- ‚ùå Don't remove existing features
- ‚ùå Don't change element IDs
- ‚ùå Don't restructure HTML
- ‚ùå Don't duplicate code
- ‚ùå Don't over-engineer the solution
