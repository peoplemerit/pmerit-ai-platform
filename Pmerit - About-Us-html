        <div class="container">
            <h2>The Origin Story</h2>
            <div class="origin-story">
                <p><strong>"My people perish for lack of knowledge"</strong> (Hosea 4:6) - This biblical truth isn't just PMERIT's founding principle, it's the lived experience of our founder that drives our mission to transform lives globally.</p>
                
                <p><strong>From Abandonment to Achievement:</strong> Born as the 14th of 15 children in a polygamous Christian home in Nigeria, our founder's journey embodies the very struggles PMERIT seeks to address. Despite his father's wealth as a sawmiller, educational support came with conditions - children had to serve the family business for years in exchange for schooling.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Walking the Path of Resilience:</strong> Every morning during secondary school, he walked 3.4 kilometers from Ogbun Village near Oluwo to Orile Igbore Grammar School, racing back by 3:30 PM to work on the farm and sawmill. When he couldn't meet his father's demanding expectations at age 11, he was disowned and cast out - forced to navigate life alone while continuing his education through sheer determination and faith.</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Power of Knowledge:</strong> Working countless jobs to survive and fund his education, he passed his WAEC examination and eventually earned admission to college through his siblings' help. His life transformed when he won the US visa lottery, leading to a BSc in Accounting from the University of North Carolina Greensboro, a Master's in Accounting and Finance from Purdue University, and four years of service in the US National Guard.</p>
                
                <p><strong>From Personal Pain to Global Purpose:</strong> This journey from abandonment to achievement in both Nigeria and the US revealed a universal truth: millions of brilliant minds are trapped not by lack of potential, but by lack of accessible, quality education. Having lived the struggle in Nigerian villages and witnessed similar challenges in underserved American communities, our founder envisioned AI-powered education as the bridge to break these poverty cycles.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Today's Mission:</strong> What began as one child's fight for education has evolved into PMERIT's mission to serve 3+ billion underserved learners worldwide. Our dual-market strategy leverages deep Nigerian cultural understanding and American educational innovation to create a platform that speaks to every learner's context while providing world-class educational opportunities.</p>
